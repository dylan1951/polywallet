# PolyWallet

The goal of PolyWallet is to be a simple cryptocurrency developer wallet that abstracts away all the
chain-specific details.

You can generate new addresses for different coins, be notified when those addresses are sent crypto, send from those
addresses and check the balance of each address.

It does nothing fancy. This gives you maximum flexibility without needing to learn anything specific to any of the coins.
